                <li><strongBe Kind and Courteous:</strong>We're all in this together to create a welcoming environment. Let"s treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are natural, but kindness is required.</li>""'"'"'
                <li><strongThis is Peer Support, Not Therapy:</strong>Offer support as a peer, not as a professional. Avoid giving medical advice or diagnoses. Encourage users to seek professional help when appropriate.</li>
                <li><strongRespect Everyone"s Privacy:</strong What"s shared in the community should stay in the community. Do not ask for or share personal identifying information. Anonymity is key to our platform.</li>'"""'
                <li><strongNo Hate Speech or Bullying:</strong>Make sure everyone feels safe. Bullying of any kind isn"t allowed, and degrading comments about things like race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity will not be tolerated.</li'"""'
                <li><strongNo Promotions or Spam:</strong>Self-promotion, spam and irrelevant links aren't allowed.</li'
