## 5. DEPLOYMENT STEPS 📋

### Prerequisites
1. Netlify account with project connected
2. Environment variables set in Netlify UI (if any needed)
3. Git repository pushed to remote

### Deployment Process

#### Option A: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Production-ready build with all critical features"

# 2. Push to main branch
git push origin master

# Netlify will automatically:
# - Detect the push
# - Run npm run build:netlify
# - Deploy the dist folder
# - Provide preview URL
```

#### Option B: Manual Deployment via CLI
```bash
# 1. Install Netlify CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g netlify-cli

# 2. Login to Netlify
netlify login

# 3. Build locally
npm run build:netlify

# 4. Deploy to production
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist

# 5. Get deployment URL
netlify open
```

#### Option C: Drag & Drop Deployment
1. Run `npm run build:netlify` locally
2. Open Netlify dashboard
3. Drag the `dist` folder to the deployment area
4. Wait for processing
5. Access via provided URL

---

## 6. POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION ✅

### Immediate Checks
1. **Visit the site** - Verify it loads
2. **Check console** - No critical errors
3. **Test crisis button** - Ensure it works
4. **Try mood tracking** - Verify localStorage works
5. **Check offline mode** - Disable network and test

### Performance Verification
```bash
# Run Lighthouse audit
npx lighthouse https://astralcorev2.netlify.app --view

# Expected scores:
# Performance: > 85
# Accessibility: > 90
# Best Practices: > 90
# SEO: > 85
```

## 7. KNOWN ISSUES & MITIGATIONS ⚠️

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **Sentry source map warnings** - Not critical, monitoring works
2. **Version check disabled** - Temporary fix, can be re-enabled later
3. **Some API features unavailable** - Expected without backend

### Mitigations Applied
- Emergency HTML fallback in build script
- MIME type headers explicitly set
- Multiple build strategies for reliability
- Compression for performance

---

## 8. ROLLBACK PLAN 🔄

If issues occur post-deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Via Netlify UI
   # Go to Deploys > Click on previous successful deploy > Publish deploy
   ```

2. **Fix and Redeploy**
   ```bash
   # Make fixes locally
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: [describe issue]"
   git push origin master
   ```
