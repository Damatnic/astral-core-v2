## üì¶ Build Configuration

### Current Build Setup (netlify.toml)
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build:netlify"
  functions = "netlify/functions"
  publish = "dist"
  
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20.18.1"
  NPM_VERSION = "10.9.2"
  NODE_OPTIONS = "--max-old-space-size=4096"
```

### Optimized Build Process
The platform uses a bulletproof build script that:
1. Cleans previous builds
2. Runs Vite build with optimizations
3. Generates service worker
4. Validates output
5. Reports build status

## üîê Security Configuration

### Headers (Configured in netlify.toml)
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- HTTPS enforcement via redirects

### Data Protection
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- JWT-based session management
- Encrypted database connections
- No hardcoded secrets in codebase

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Netlify

```bash
# Required Variables (Minimum for Basic Functionality)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]/[database]?sslmode=require"
JWT_SECRET="[32+ character random string]"

# Recommended Variables (For Full Features)
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..." # For AI chat features
VITE_SENTRY_DSN="https://..." # For error tracking
```

### Step 2: Database Setup

1. **Create Neon Database**
   - Sign up at neon.tech
   - Create new project
   - Copy connection string

2. **Run Migrations**
   ```sql
   -- Run files in order from database/migrations/
   -- 001_initial_setup.sql
   -- 002_seed_data.sql
   ```

### Step 3: Deploy

**Option A: Git Integration (Recommended)**
```bash
# 1. Push to repository
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy production-ready platform"
git push origin main

# 2. In Netlify Dashboard:
# - Connect Git repository
# - Auto-deploy enabled
```

**Option B: Manual Deploy**
```bash
# Using Netlify CLI
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# 1. Check health endpoint
curl https://[your-site].netlify.app/api/health

# 2. Verify crisis resources
curl https://[your-site].netlify.app/crisis-resources.json

# 3. Test PWA installation
# - Visit site in Chrome/Edge
# - Look for install prompt

# 4. Test offline mode
# - Install PWA
# - Disconnect internet
# - Verify crisis resources still accessible
```
