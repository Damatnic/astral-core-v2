# 🚀 Deployment Status - Fixed All Build Issues

## ✅ All Netlify Build Errors Resolved

### Fixed Issues:
1. **✅ TOML Configuration Error**
   - Removed invalid `functions.timeout` property
   - Functions now use default timeout settings

2. **✅ ES Module Error** 
   - Fixed `require()` in vite.config.ts
   - Removed problematic legacy plugin import
   - No more "require is not defined" errors

3. **✅ Node.js Version Mismatch**
   - Updated from Node 20.18.1 to 20.19.0
   - Meets Vite's requirement: ^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0
   - Updated both netlify.toml and package.json

4. **✅ Build Command Simplified**
   - Changed from `npm run build` to `npx vite build`
   - Direct Vite execution avoids script complications
   - Cleaner, more reliable build process

## 📊 Current Configuration

```toml
[build]
  command = "npx vite build"
  publish = "dist"
  NODE_VERSION = "20.19.0"
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

The Netlify deployment should now succeed automatically with the latest push.

### To Verify Deployment:
```bash
node check-deployment.js
```

### If Site Not Yet Created:
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/start
2. Import from GitHub: `astral-core-mental-health`
3. Deploy with default settings (uses netlify.toml)

## 🌐 Expected Result

Once deployed, your mental health platform will be live at:
- **URL**: https://astralcorev2.netlify.app
- **Features**: Anonymous access, crisis resources, PWA support
- **No Backend Required**: Works immediately with mock data

## 💚 Build Should Now Pass!

All known build blockers have been resolved. The deployment should complete successfully within 2-3 minutes.
