## Estimated Timeline: 7-10 weeks total

**Priority Order:**
1. **Crisis Detection System** - Safety critical, must work first
2. **TypeScript Compilation** - Blocks all development  
3. **Missing Components** - Prevents basic navigation
4. **Store Systems** - Required for data persistence
5. **Test Suite** - Ensures system stability
6. **Advanced Features** - Performance and user experience

This restoration plan prioritizes user safety (crisis detection) and basic functionality before moving to optimization and polish.
