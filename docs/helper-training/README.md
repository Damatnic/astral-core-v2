## üí¨ Communication Best Practices

### Active Listening Techniques
- **Reflect feelings**: "It sounds like you're feeling..."
- **Summarize content**: "Let me make sure I understand..."
- **Ask open questions**: "Can you tell me more about...?"
- **Validate experiences**: "That must have been really difficult"
- **Avoid advice-giving**: Focus on supporting their own problem-solving

### Helpful Response Examples

**For Someone Feeling Overwhelmed:**
"It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. That feeling of being overwhelmed is really tough. What's helped you cope with difficult times in the past?"

**For Someone Expressing Hopelessness:**
"I hear that things feel really dark right now. Those feelings are incredibly painful. Have you been thinking about hurting yourself? There are people who want to help you through this."

**For Someone Sharing Progress:**
"It's wonderful that you're recognizing those positive changes. Recovery isn't always linear, and celebrating these moments is so important. What do you think has contributed to this progress?"

### What NOT to Say
‚ùå "I know exactly how you feel"  
‚ùå "Everything happens for a reason"  
‚ùå "You should just think positive"  
‚ùå "At least you don't have [other problem]"  
‚ùå "You're being too sensitive"  

### What TO Say Instead
‚úÖ "That sounds really difficult"  
‚úÖ "Thank you for sharing this with me"  
‚úÖ "You're not alone in feeling this way"  
‚úÖ "It makes sense that you would feel this way"  
‚úÖ "What kind of support would be most helpful right now?"

- Providing effective support to others
- Modeling healthy behaviors for the community

### Daily Self-Care Practices
- **Check in with yourself** before and after helping sessions
- **Set boundaries** around availability and involvement
- **Practice grounding techniques** when feeling overwhelmed
- **Maintain your own support systems** outside of the helper role
- **Engage in activities** that bring you joy and relaxation

### Warning Signs of Helper Burnout
- Feeling emotionally drained after interactions
- Losing empathy or feeling frustrated with users
- Neglecting your own mental health needs
- Having difficulty sleeping or concentrating
- Feeling responsible for users' outcomes
- Avoiding supervision or peer support

### When to Take a Break
- **Immediately**: If you're experiencing crisis yourself
- **Temporarily**: During major life stresses or changes
- **As needed**: When showing signs of burnout
- **Regularly**: Schedule planned breaks and vacation time
